    <!-- INSECTOID MECHADENDRITES -->
    <!-- 
    Uses Insect Meat and or Insect Jelly to be crafted
    Potentially weaker or stronger than mechanical counter-parts with unique aspects
    Perhaps move rancher mechadendrite into this grouping to represent insectoids farming?
    Need to garner ideas from others
    Divide into three or more main groups: Worker, Hunter, Royal
    Worker: Classical production mechadendrites now with insectoid theming
    Hunter: Assist with the hunting of prey and defending of the colony, maybe rename to Warrior?
    Royal: Mechadendrite additions fitting for a queen or princess of the colony
