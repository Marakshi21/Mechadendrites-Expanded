    <description> Revision: Nova
    Mechadendrites Expanded: Nova is a revision/rework/overhaul of the original Mechadendrites Expanded mod that seeks to fix a variety of flaws found within the original mod that I found took away from gameplay more than helped. A primary example of this is how the amount of mechadendrite slots is planned to be reduced to 4 instead of 6 and progression is being reworked entirely. The old system of basic -> refined -> standard -> hardened is being dropped too in favour of a more vanilla style progression of basic -> standard -> high -> ultra or a different system that has less ambiguity on what tier is when. Specializations are being changed too to be less hyper-specific and more appropiate to what each Mechadendrite is called to further reduce ambiguity and improve the flow of progression.
